## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL to clone the repository to your local machine. For example:

   git clone https://github.com/vaibhavmane09/News-App.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Repository:** Use the cd command to navigate into the cloned repository directory.

   cd News-App
   ```
3.  **Make Changes:** Edit the files in the repository using your preferred text editor or IDE.

4. **Stage Changes:** Once you've made changes, you need to stage them for commit using the git add command. You can add individual files or directories, or use a wildcard to add all changes.
    ```bash
    # Add specific file
    git add filename

    # Add all changes
    git add .

    ```
5. **Commit Changes:** After staging the changes, commit them with a descriptive commit message using the git commit command.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"

    ```

6. **Push Changes to GitHub:** Finally, push the committed changes to GitHub using the git push command.
    ```bash
    git push origin main

    ```
Replace main with the name of your branch if you're working on a branch other than the main branch.

7. **Verify Changes on GitHub:** Once the push is successful, visit your repository on GitHub to verify that the changes have been pushed.


## Available Scripts to Run and De

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
